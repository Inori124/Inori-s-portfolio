## 👋 Hello, I'm Ying!

My name is **Ying Cao**, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in **Applied Statistics** at **Beijing Normal University**.
With a solid background in mathematics and statistics, my work centers on using data-driven methods to reduce uncertainty and support informed decision-making.

My approach to data science is grounded in **first-principles thinking**: starting from the problem itself, clarifying assumptions, and selecting methods that are both statistically sound and practically meaningful. During my internship at **ByteDance**, I worked on **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** for large language models, focusing on the construction and evaluation of high-quality mathematical reasoning data. By designing structured evaluation criteria, I contributed to improving the logical consistency and reliability of model outputs in educational contexts.

My current academic interests lie at the intersection of **statistical modeling, educational assessment, and machine learning applications**. I am particularly interested in how interpretable models and well-designed evaluation frameworks can bridge theory and real-world deployment, especially in large-scale assessment and AI-assisted learning systems.

Beyond technical work, I value clear communication and structured storytelling. I believe that a good data scientist not only builds models, but also explains results in ways that others can understand, trust, and act upon.
